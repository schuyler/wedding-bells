/**
 * Recording view component for capturing audio messages.
 * 
 * This component handles the audio recording phase of the workflow,
 * providing an interface for users to record their message.
 * It's a pure refactor from App.tsx recording state.
 * 
 * Component Flow:
 * 1. Displays audio recorder interface
 * 2. Handles recording state management
 * 3. Processes recording completion/cancellation
 * 
 * @component
 * @returns {React.ReactElement} Recording interface
 * 
 * Technical Architecture:
 * - Implements view layer of recording state
 * - Uses AudioRecorder component for capture
 * - Manages local recording state
 * - Pure presentational component (logic handled by parent)
 * 
 * State Management:
 * - Tracks recording status (active/paused)
 * - Handles recording completion
 * - Manages cancellation flow
