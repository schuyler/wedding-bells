# Marc With A Sea Wedding Website - Development Progress

## Notes
Note: Entries below are ordered by date, newest first (reverse chronological order).

2025-02-26: Volume Indicator Improvements:
1. Issues identified:
   - Volume bars weren't accurately representing normal speaking volume
   - Color thresholds weren't optimally set for user feedback
   - Raw RMS values didn't match human perception of loudness

2. Solution implemented:
   - Added logarithmic scaling using decibels (20 * log10(rms))
   - Made volume levels configurable with min/max decibel range
   - Set appropriate range for speech (-40dB to -10dB)
   - Adjusted color thresholds (7 green, 2 yellow, 1 red bars)

3. Technical details:
   - Added VolumeConfig interface for configurable ranges
   - Implemented decibel conversion for better volume perception
   - Updated color thresholds to better indicate optimal recording levels
   - Added epsilon to prevent Math.log10(0) issues

4. Lessons learned:
   - Linear RMS values don't match human perception of loudness
   - Decibel scale better represents audio levels
   - Important to consider typical speech volume ranges
   - Visual feedback should guide users to optimal recording levels

2025-02-26: Waveform Visualization Improvements:
1. Issues identified:
   - Waveform movement was 5-10x slower than expected
   - Amplitude scaling was distracting due to automatic normalization
   - Data accumulation causing performance issues

2. Solution implemented:
   - Reduced window to 3 seconds for faster updates
   - Set zoom level to 50px/sec for balanced visualization
   - Disabled continuous waveform mode to prevent data accumulation
   - Disabled normalization to prevent amplitude scaling
   - Enabled smooth scrolling

3. Technical details:
   - WaveSurfer configuration optimized for real-time display
   - Record plugin settings tuned for performance
   - Raw audio data preserved for post-processing

4. Lessons learned:
   - Continuous waveform mode can cause performance issues
   - Audio normalization better handled in post-processing
   - Smaller visualization window improves real-time feedback
   - Important to balance visual feedback with performance

2025-02-26: Progress Indicator UI Fix:
1. Issue: Progress dot connector lines weren't properly connecting in browser
2. Solution implemented:
   - Used absolute positioning for connector lines
   - Ensured perfect alignment with left-full positioning
   - Added proper spacing with space-x utilities
   - Implemented responsive sizing
3. Technical details:
   - Lines positioned relative to dots using absolute positioning
   - Center alignment achieved with top-1/2 and -translate-y-1/2
   - Width matches parent spacing (w-8/w-14 matching space-x-8/space-x-14)
4. Lessons learned:
   - Absolute positioning provides more reliable connection between elements than fixed widths
   - Using parent spacing to determine line width ensures consistency
   - Important to maintain responsive behavior while fixing layout issues

2025-02-26: Form Simplification:
1. Removed optional email collection:
   - Simplified GuestInfo interface to only require name
   - Updated form validation schema to remove email field
   - Removed email input field from welcome form
   - Verified form submission works correctly
   
2. Benefits:
   - Streamlined user experience
   - Reduced friction in recording process
   - Simplified data model
   - Maintained core functionality without optional fields

2025-02-26: CSS Configuration Fix:
1. Identified issue with Tailwind CSS configuration:
   - Styles were not being applied at all, then page failed to load completely
   - Error: "Cannot apply unknown utility class: bg-white"
   - Root cause: Tailwind CSS v4 moved PostCSS plugin to separate package

2. Research findings:
   - In Tailwind CSS v4, the PostCSS plugin was moved from main `tailwindcss` package to `@tailwindcss/postcss`
   - Having both packages in dependencies caused conflicts
   - Package.json had future-dated versions (v4.0.9 from 2025-02-25)

3. Solution implemented:
   - Downgraded to Tailwind CSS v3.4.1 which includes PostCSS plugin directly
   - Updated postcss.config.js to use `tailwindcss` directly instead of `@tailwindcss/postcss`
   - Adjusted PostCSS version to 8.4.31 for compatibility
   - Removed `@tailwindcss/postcss` from devDependencies

4. Lessons learned:
   - When upgrading to Tailwind CSS v4 in the future, will need to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` package
   - Important to check compatibility between PostCSS and Tailwind CSS versions
   - Simpler to use stable v3.x for current project phase

2024-02-26: Permission Handling Improvements:
1. Identified issue with permission handling approach:
   - Was checking permissions too early
   - Had complex UI for permission states
   - Not following standard Web Audio API patterns

2. Researched standard patterns:
   - Found MDN Web Audio API examples
   - Identified simpler permission flow
   - Confirmed browser's native permission UI is preferred

3. Simplified implementation:
   - Updated BrowserCheck to only verify basic audio support
   - Removed pre-emptive permission checking
   - Now using browser's native permission UI
   - Improved error messages for different states
   - Currently fixing oversized icon issue in denied state

4. Testing Progress:
   - Verified browser compatibility check works (tested by disabling Web Audio API)
   - Confirmed permission flow works (tested granting/denying access)
   - Found UI issue with denied state that needs fixing

2024-02-26: Added Phase 6: Final Enhancements to the implementation plan, focusing on accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support) and error recovery & resilience (local storage backup, auto-retry, offline handling). Updated project documentation to reflect these additions.

2024-02-26: Reorganized testing plan to prioritize frontend testing with mocked uploads before backend integration. Split testing into two clear phases: Phase 1 for pure frontend testing and Phase 2 for backend integration. Updated TESTING.md to reflect this progression.

   - Reference: https://wavesurfer.xyz/examples/?record.js
   - Identified plugin as better solution for real-time visualization

3. Refactoring:
   - Updated WaveformVisualizer to use Record plugin
   - Added continuous waveform visualization

Components are ready for Phase 3 audio implementation.

2024-02-24: Completed Phase 1 setup - Initialized Vite+React+TS project, configured TailwindCSS, created component structure. Added placeholder implementations for AudioRecorder, WaveformVisualizer, and UploadProgress components. Basic project architecture and type definitions in place.

2024-02-24: Project initialized. Planning phase begun. Scope defined as simple recording interface with audio visualization and 15-minute limit.

## Suggestions
- Add countdown timer during recording
- Show upload progress with percentage
- Add basic error handling for failed uploads or unsupported browsers
- Consider adding a volume level indicator separate from waveform
- Add keyboard shortcuts for recording controls
- Consider adding background music option
- Add visual feedback for volume levels
- Implement auto-retry for failed uploads
- Add offline support with local storage
