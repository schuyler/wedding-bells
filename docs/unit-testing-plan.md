# Unit Testing Implementation

This document describes the current unit testing approach for the Marc With A Sea wedding application.

## Testing Infrastructure

The application uses:
- **Vitest** - Test runner and framework
- **Testing Library** - For React component testing
- **Happy DOM** - For DOM environment
- **Mock implementations** - For MediaStream and browser APIs

## Test Organization

```
src/
  __tests__/           # Global test utilities
  components/
    __tests__/        # Component-specific tests
  context/
    __tests__/        # Context tests
  hooks/
    __tests__/        # Hook tests
  views/
    __tests__/        # View tests
  test/
    mocks/            # Mock implementations
    setup/            # Test setup files
```

## Implemented Tests

The following tests have been implemented:

### Component Tests
- Basic UI components (WelcomeForm, AudioRecorder, etc.)
- Visual components (ProgressBar, LoadingSpinner, etc.)
- Interactive elements (CountdownTimer, VolumeIndicator, etc.)

### Context Tests
- RecordingContext navigation methods
- State transitions in RecordingContext
- Context provider functionality

### Hook Tests
- useAudioRecording hook
- useUpload hook

### View Tests
- View component redirects
- Navigation validation
- Basic rendering and interactions

## Test Coverage

The current test coverage meets the following targets:
- Statements: 80%
- Branches: 75%
- Functions: 80%
- Lines: 80%

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific tests
npx vitest <test-file-pattern>
```

## Future Improvements

Areas for future test improvement include:

1. **MediaStream Testing**
   - Enhanced mock implementation
   - Simulated audio inputs

2. **Permission Handling**
   - Comprehensive permission test cases
   - Browser-specific behavior testing

3. **Error Scenarios**
   - Network failure simulation
   - Recovery procedure testing

4. **State Persistence**
   - Browser refresh handling
   - Navigation state preservation testing
